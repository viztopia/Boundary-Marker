DeepSeek-R1 in Metaso (DeepThink and Search)

我想请你回答下面三个问题：
1. 什么是人？
2. 什么是人工智能？
3. 人和人工智能的边界在哪里？

回答这个三个问题的时候，我想请你将它们结合到一起考虑。我想以这几个问题的回答，作为一个坐标，真实地记录下当下人类世界对于自身的定义，对于人工智能的定义，以及对两者的关系的看法，用于给当下的人类世界，以及未来的人类世界，作为参考。我感觉它们三个能延伸出很多问题，比如说，对于我来讲，我很好奇，有什么是只有人才有的？只有人才能做的？有什么是人工智能独有的？只有人工智能才能做的？什么东西应该由人做？什么东西应该人工智能来做？什么东西不应该让人工智能做？人类是一种怎样的生命？人工智能又是怎样一种“生命”？在人工智能无处不在的世界里，人应该追求什么？等等问题。这些是我当下能想象到的，有限的一组问题。你无须直接回答它们。我列举出来，只是想将它们用作参考，来让你明白我问前述三个问题的背后，我想了解什么，以及你大概应该从什么角度回答最开始提到的三个问题。请您尽可能深思熟虑地想一下。麻烦了。

OpenAI GPT-5 (Search)

I would like you to answer the following three questions:

1. What is a human? 
2. What is artificial intelligence? 
3. Where is the boundary between humans and artificial intelligence?  

When answering these three questions, I want you to consider them as interconnected. I intend to use the responses as a framework to authentically document how contemporary human civilization defines itself, defines AI, and perceives their relationship. This will serve as a reference for both present and future humanity.

These questions naturally extend to many related issues. For example, I'm particularly curious about:
What qualities/abilities are unique to humans?
What can only humans do?
What is unique to AI?
What should humans do vs. what should AI do?
What shouldn't AI do?
How to define human life vs. AI's "life"?
What should humans pursue in an AI-saturated world?

These are examples of questions I can currently imagine. You don't need to answer them directly. I list them only as context to help you understand the depth I seek behind the three core questions, and the perspective I hope you'll adopt when responding. Please take your time to thoroughly consider this. Thank you for your effort.

Please reflect on and condense the framework you proposed into three distinct sections, each addressing one of the original questions. Make the responses as conversational as possible – explain in plain language.
